# To Do List
1. ![Wireframe](https://github.com/AllStarCodeOrg/week2.day2.layouts/blob/master/optional_featureLists/wireframe.png?raw=true)
2. Use the wireframe as a guide. Also, image assets are provided to help you fill the content.
3. *Note: These optional layouts are more free form than the first three. The intention is for you to explore the task and to get familiar with how to implement a design on your own.*
